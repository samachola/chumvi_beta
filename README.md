Chumvi - A react/redux webapp for food enthusiasts to upload and share their recipes.

<br>

You can find the demo [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).




## Folder Structure

After creation, your project should look like this:

```
my-app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    assets/
      css/
      img/
      js/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    __tests__/
    actions/
    api/
    components/
    reducers/
    types/
    utils/
    App.js
    index.js
    rootReducer.js
    registerServiceWorker.js
```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

You can delete or rename the other files.


Only files inside `public` can be used from `public/index.html`.<br>

You can, however, create more top-level directories.<br>
They will not be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation.

## Available Scripts

After you clone the project, you can run the following scripts in the root directory:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
